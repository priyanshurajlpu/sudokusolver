The HTML structure consists of a table representing the Sudoku board, with each cell as a <td> element. The board has a 9x9 grid, divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. Users can enter numbers from 1 to 9 in the cells to represent the Sudoku puzzle.

The JavaScript code contains several event listeners and functions to handle user interactions and solve the Sudoku puzzle:

keyup event listener: This event listener is attached to the Sudoku board. It triggers whenever a key is released in a cell (<td>). It validates the entered value and keeps only valid numbers from 1 to 9. Invalid entries are cleared from the cell.

solve-button click event listener: When the "Solve!" button is clicked, this event listener is triggered. It retrieves the current state of the Sudoku board, converts it into a string representation, and passes it to the SudokuSolver.solve function. If a valid solution is found, it updates the Sudoku board with the solved puzzle. Otherwise, an alert is shown indicating that the board is invalid.

clear-button click event listener: This event listener is triggered when the "Clear board" button is clicked. It clears all the cells on the Sudoku board, resetting it to the initial state.

boardToString function: This function converts the current Sudoku board state into a string representation. It iterates over the cells (<td> elements) and appends the corresponding values or "-" if the cell is empty.

stringToBoard function: This function takes a string representation of a Sudoku board and updates the HTML board with the provided values. It iterates over the cells and assigns the values from the string to the corresponding cells.
